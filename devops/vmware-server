This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions about how to install the free VMware Server (version 1.0.2) on a Debian Etch system.

With VMware Server you can create and run guest operating systems ("virtual machines") such as Linux, Windows, FreeBSD, etc. under a host operating system. This has the benefit that you can run multiple operating systems on the same hardware which saves a lot of money, and you can move virtual machines from one VMware Server to the next one (or to a system that has the VMware Player which is also free). In this article we use Debian Etch (4.0) as the host operating system.

I want to say first that this is not the only way of setting up such a system. There are many ways of achieving this goal but this is the way I take. I do not issue any guarantee that this will work for you!

 

1 Preliminary Note
I assume you have already set up a basic Debian Etch system. You can set up your system as described on the first two pages of this tutorial: The Perfect Setup - Debian Etch (4.0).

I use 192.168.0.100 as the IP address and server1.example.com as the hostname of my Debian Etch system in this tutorial. If your Debian Etch system does not have a static IP address you should now change its network configuration so that it will have a static IP address in the future:

vi /etc/network/interfaces

# /etc/network/interfaces -- configuration file for ifup(8), ifdown(8)

# The loopback interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The first network card - this entry was created during the Debian installation
# (network, broadcast and gateway are optional)
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
        address 192.168.0.100
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        network 192.168.0.0
        broadcast 192.168.0.255
        gateway 192.168.0.1
(If you use a different gateway than 192.168.0.1, change the gateway IP address in /etc/network/interfaces.)

Then restart your network:

/etc/init.d/networking restart

Edit /etc/resolv.conf and add some nameservers:

vi /etc/resolv.conf

search server
nameserver 145.253.2.75
nameserver 193.174.32.18
nameserver 194.25.0.60
Edit /etc/hosts and add your new IP address:

vi /etc/hosts

127.0.0.1       localhost.localdomain   localhost
192.168.0.100   server1.example.com     server1


# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
ff02::3 ip6-allhosts
 

2 Installing Required Packages
First we update our package database:

apt-get update

Now we install the packages required by VMware on our Debian Etch system by running

apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r` libx11-6 libx11-dev x-window-system-core x-window-system xspecs libxtst6 psmisc build-essential

You will be asked a few questions to which you can answer as follows:


 
Please keep only the resolutions you would like the X server to use. Removing all of them is the same as removing none, since in both cases the X server will attempt to use the highest possible resolution.

Video modes to be used by the X server:

<--Accept the default values

The resolution values are not really important because we don't want to use the desktop on our Debian Etch system. We will connect to the VMware Server from our workstation later on which can be a Windows or Linux system which has the VMware Server client package installed.

Next we create the directory /var/vm where we want to install our virtual machines later. The virtual machines require much disk space, make sure you have enough free space on your /var partition for the virtual machines.

mkdir /var/vm

 

3 Getting VMware Server
The VMware server can be downloaded for free from the VMware website: http://www.vmware.com/download/server/
To run the VMware Server software you need a (free) serial number, that can be requested by clicking on the "Register now" button on the download page.

 

4 Downloading The Software
To setup VMWare Server on Debian Etch, we need the following packages from the VMware downloads page:

VMware Server for linux (Binary tar.gz)
Management Interface (Binary tar.gz)

We want to download the packages to our /tmp directory, therefore we go there:

cd /tmp

For downloading the software to your server, I recommend to use the Linux commandline program wget. The wget syntax is as follows:

wget [URL of the VMware Server for linux binary tar.gz package]
wget [URL of the Management Interface binary tar.gz package]

Unpacking the VMware-server tar.gz:

tar xvfz VMware-server-*.tar.gz

Running the installer script:

cd vmware-server-distrib
./vmware-install.pl

The installer asks you a few questions. Most of the time you can accept the default value:

Creating a new installer database using the tar3 format.

Installing the content of the package.

In which directory do you want to install the binary files?
[/usr/bin] <-- /usr/bin

What is the directory that contains the init directories (rc0.d/ to rc6.d/)?
[/etc] <-- /etc

What is the directory that contains the init scripts?
[/etc/init.d] <-- /etc/init.d

successfully. You can decide to remove this software from your system at any
time by invoking the following command: "/usr/bin/vmware-uninstall.pl".
